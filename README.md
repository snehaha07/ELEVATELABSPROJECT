I used Customer Personality Analysis dataset for task1. Uploaded the  data set in excel. Dataset was in csv format. Formatted the data into different columns using text to column option in data tab. Applied filter option for identifying null values. also used countblank function for identifying null values. Used Find and select option in Data tab for highlighting null values. Used text format options to format date in the format given in the task and used remove duplicate options in Data tabs to remove any duplicates. There were no duplicates.
